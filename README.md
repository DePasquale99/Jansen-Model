Cortical column models
===============
### A repository to store all of the models that I tried during thesis


## Table of contents

 - **Jansen** -> Jansen model of a cortical column  
 - **LaNMM** -> Laminar model of a cortical column  
 - **LaNMM_Network** -> LaNMM implemented on a network of brain areas  
 - **Data_analysis** -> Takes the data simulated in LaNMM network and prints it in different ways
 - **Data** -> folder in which the data are stored, both from the preprocessing and the simulation.
 - **network_test** -> contains the preliminary tests for the correct functioning of LaNMM network
 - **Balloon** -> contains the balloon model for BOLD signal simulation, that takes as input data from a single LaNMM model
 - **Balloon_net** -> Balloon model written to function on the entire network
 - **LaNMM_BOLD** -> Contains the implementation of both the LaNMM and balloon model, providing directly the result of the simulation as BOLD signal
 - **Thalamus** -> Contains the implementation of a single thalamus NMM
 - **Hilbert** -> Contains the analysis done with the Hilbert transform
 - **Thalamus_net** -> Full network model with thalamus areas


## Network LaNMM description

this file is the core of the project and contains all of the most important functions
